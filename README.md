# QWERTY Attack

## Motivation

QWERTY Attack is a rhythm-based typing game in which the player's aim is to press horizontally scrolling "KeyNotes" when they reach the Hit Zone.

While the primary aim of QWERTY Attack is entertainment, we recognize the educational value of this game, and therefore develop with the goal of flexibility to include alternative keyboard layouts and languages.
